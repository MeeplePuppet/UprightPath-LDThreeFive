It Came- Was it from us or not? 

Anyway, it's a semi-stealth based game where you play the part of a transforming monster who moves through space ships and attacks them. 

Player Forms: 
Sneaking- Small enough to pass through vents and the fastest form (the darker portions of the map.) 
Hide- Transforms into a box that can attack (which is immobile but deals large amounts of damage when it attacks.) 
Eating- Larger form that eats enemies when it attacks healing itself while dealing damage (slow, provokes attacks.) 
Human- Has a ranged attack that deals a point of damage per attack (attacking may provoke attacks.) 

Controls- Look at the Options in game (mostly keyboard control.) 

Levels- 
3 Currently, intended to do 5, to tell the story of the monster's escape.
